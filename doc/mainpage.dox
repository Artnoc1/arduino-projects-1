This distribution contains a bunch of libraries and example applications
that I have made for Arduino, covering a variety of tasks from blinking LED's
to LCD's and RTC-based alarm clocks.  They are distributed under the
terms of the MIT license, with the source code available from
<a href="https://github.com/rweather/arduino-projects">github</a>.

If you are looking for my cryptography libraries for Arduino, then they
can be found <a href="https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs">here</a>.

For more information on these libraries, to report bugs, or to suggest
improvements, please contact the author Rhys Weatherley via
<a href="mailto:rhys.weatherley@gmail.com">email</a>.

\section main_LCD LCD Shield

\li LCD class to manage the extended features of the Freetronics
and DFRobot LCD shields.
\li Form and Field classes to build simple property sheet UI's on LCD displays.
\li \ref lcd_hello_world "Hello World" example for the Freetronics LCD shield.
\li \ref lcd_form "Form" example for LCD displays.

\section main_DMD Freetronics Large Dot Matrix Display (DMD)

\li DMD class to manage the initialize of the display.
\li Bitmap class to manage drawing to in-memory bitmaps and the DMD display.
\li \ref dmd_demo "Demo" that shows off various bitmap drawing features.
\li \ref dmd_running_figure "RunningFigure" example that demonstrates how
to draw and animate bitmaps.
\li \ref ir_snake "Snake" game that combines the dot matrix display with
IRreceiver to make a simple video game.

\section main_BlinkLED BlinkLED Utility Library

\li BlinkLED class that simplifies the process of blinking a LED connected
to a output pin.
\li ChaseLEDs class that simplifies the process of performing a LED chase
over several output pins.
\li Charlieplex class that manages a matrix of LED's arranged in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing">Charlieplexing</a>
arrangement.
\li \ref blink_blink "Blink" example of using BlinkLED.
\li \ref blink_cylon "Cylon" example of using ChaseLEDs to simulate
the Cylon eye effect from Battlestar Galactica.
\li \ref blink_startrek "StarTrek" example for lighting a starship
Enterprise model kit.
\li \ref blink_charlieplex "Charlieplex" example.

\section main_I2C I2C Utility Library

\li I2CMaster abstract class that provides an improved API for implementing an
I2C master.
\li SoftI2C class that implements the master side of the I2C protocol
in software on any arbitrary pair of pins for DATA and CLOCK.
This class supports both 7-bit and 10-bit I2C addresses.
\li EEPROM24 class for reading and writing 24LCXX family EEPROM's.

\section main_RTC Realtime Clock Library

\li RTC class that acts as a base for all realtime clock implementations,
including support for configuring alarms and storing clock settings.
The default implementation simulates the time and date based on the value of
<tt>millis()</tt>.
\li DS1307RTC class that talks to the DS1307 realtime clock chip via I2C.
\li DS3231RTC class that talks to the DS3231 realtime clock chip via I2C.
\li DS3232RTC class that talks to the DS3232 realtime clock chip via I2C.
\li \ref alarm_clock "Alarm Clock" example that uses the DS1307 or DS3232
realtime clock and the LCD library to implement an alarm clock.

\section main_Crypto Cryptographic Library

The cryptography libraries are now in a separate
<a href="https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs">repository</a>.

\section main_Shell Shell Library

\li Terminal class that extends Stream with functions suitable for
interfacing to a VT100-compatible terminal program like PuTTY.
\li Shell class that manages a Unix-like command-line shell for executing
commands via a serial port or telnet session.  Shell is built on top of
the functionality of Terminal.
\li LoginShell class that extends Shell to provide a simple username and
password login mechanism.
\li \ref shell_serial "SerialShell" example that shows how to use Shell to
provide command-line access via a serial port.
\li \ref shell_telnet "TelnetServer" example that shows how to use
LoginShell to provide command-line access via the telnet protocol.

\section main_IR Infrared Control Library

\li IRreceiver class that receives incoming RC-5 commands from an
infrared remote control.
\li \ref ir_dumpir "DumpIR" example that dumps all incoming RC-5 commands.
\li \ref ir_snake "Snake" game that combines DMD with an infrared remote
control to make a simple video game.

\section main_other Other

\li Melody plays a melody on a digital output pin using <tt>tone()</tt>.
\li \ref power_save "Power saving utility functions"
